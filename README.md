### File_Selector
Adjust the settings at the bottom of `file_selector/fileSelector.py` to traverse a specified folder and retrieve all the file names where variable and/or return types are specified in the docstring as well as those docstrings.
Additionally, the parameters allow you to either print the output to the console or write them to a file.
